1. Put raw data in this folder (folders "sample0", "sample1" ... "sampleN")
2. mkdir pkls answers
3. add_noise_centers.py 1) detects centres 2) adds noise to the data, cuts it into short clips, flips-rotates the images
4. centers_distrib.py reads images with marked centers from "answers" and outputs the distribution (sum of the images, essentially)
